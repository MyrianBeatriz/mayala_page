      Hi there! I’m Myrian, and I’m really glad you found your way here. <br>

      This space started as a small experiment — part journal, part digital lab — where I can share notes, ideas, and lessons from the things I love most: cybersecurity, travel, financial freedom, human connection, and the art of living curiously.<br>
      <br>
      I’ve always believed that the best way to learn is to explore, break things (ethically 😉), and rebuild them with a better understanding. Over time, I realized I wanted a place to document that process — the wins, the mistakes, the insights, and the random sparks that happen along the way.
      <br>
      <strong>So that’s what this page is about:</strong><br>
      ✨ Stories from the road and from the command line.<br>
      🧠 Notes on mindset, growth, and balance.<br>
      💻 Experiments in hacking, building, and creating.<br>

      If something here makes you think, laugh, or learn something new — that’s the goal.<br><br>

      Thanks for reading — and welcome to this evolving journey. Grab a coffee (or a mate 🧉) and explore a bit.
